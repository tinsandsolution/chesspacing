once you have the file, you can do this in notepad++:

find (without the period matching a newline): (^1\..*)\r\n 
replace with: \1 
note that there is a space afterwards

there are other regex commands to do which involve taking out the stuff in brackets
and like, newlines. but i won't bother writing them down because i know them by heart.

well actually here they are:

find: \[.*\]
replace with:

find: \r
replace with: \n

(then we run this multiple times)

find: \n\n
replace with: \n 

find: ^(.*)
replace with: "\1",


this code isn't actually perfect and is a lazy stopgap measure. 
there's a notepad++ macro i have that does these steps, making it easy to do stuff.
